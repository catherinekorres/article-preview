![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catherinekorres/article-preview/master/src/assets/images/screencapture-article-preview-final.png)

This project was built as a solution to Frontend Mentor's [Article Preview Component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/article-preview-component-dYBN_pYFT) challenge, using React and Sass.

You can find it live [here](https://article-preview-nine.vercel.app/).

Or, if you want to run it on localhost, you can run the following command on the project directory:

### `yarn start`

It will run the app in development mode.<br />
Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
